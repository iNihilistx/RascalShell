## üñ•Ô∏è About the Project

<div>
  <p1>
  Developed for my Computer Science degrees Final Year Project. This reverse shell does something unique by implementing a command center through the use of the customtkinter library. Packaged along with this shell are two client projects. CLI - Allows for the standard reverse shell functionality for executing commands and flying under the radar. GUI - Allows the shell to function more like a remote machine handler. This project uses a mixture of GUI development, encryption and socket programming using the OOP paradigm.

## üîé Features

* Secure communication between host and intended target through use of socket programming
* fully python, with use of libraries
* Graphical User Interface (GUI)
* Network indicator (shell application) - informs you of network speed and status
* Encrypted login (shell application)
* User friendly applications with secure login and connection
* Custom command implementation ~ Pressing the help button on the bottom of the right panel will display the commands
* Unsecure command blockage (commands that alter the flow of the application or deemed dangerous are within a blocked array)
